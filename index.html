            Art&iacute;s is a coffee roastary and caf&eacute; in San Francisco
            that roasts small batches to sustain peak freshness. They came
            to our team for web and video help. We delved into the brand,
            considered their core values, rally cry, customer needs,
            and digital experience.

            The archetypes that this brand embodies are the Explorer, Creator, and
            the Storyteller. Art&iacute;s is about freshness and flavor. At it's
            core, this brand is about seizing the moment since coffee peaks
            in flavor 24-48 hours after its roasted.

            The typical customer for Art&iacute;s is interested in what they are
            purchasing and especially in what they are consuming. They enjoy learning,
            so we gave them not only information about the caf&eacute; and how to roast,
            but also information about the history of the coffee and its origins.
            The voice for Art&iacute;s is casual and educated. It was important
            to balance the information presented with a reminder of how it's relevant
            to your cup. So for example: in the How to Brew sections, we explain how to make
            coffee using a Chemex, but also cover why you would want to (in case you were curious,
            it yields a cup with a light body and clean taste).

              Coffee is such a commonplace drink that it can be strange to think
              about it like wine, with regions and processing affecting the flavor
              complexities. It can be strange to start thinking about describing the way
              coffee tastes, or which coffee you like. We included a flavor profile
              quiz to help non-coneisseurs talk about the flavors they enjoyed in coffee
              and those they didn't. The quiz yields results about the region and the
              roast that you might like. It was named by SF Weekly as one of the
              best they've seen.
